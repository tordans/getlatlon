Get lat, long and zoom from a google map. 

**History and about:**

First there was http://getlatlon.com/, which is down for quite a while now.

Then there is http://getlatlon.yohman.com/, a copy of getlatlon.com, which was down today as well.

Now there is http://tordans.github.io/getlatlon/ which will be there forever â€¦ maybe. At least this version does not depend on external resources (except for Google Maps) and is hosted by Github, so it should be pretty stable.
